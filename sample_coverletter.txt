* Engineering & Process Excellence: My Mechanical Engineering degree and Lean Six Sigma Green Belt certification enable me to tackle technical challenges with a data-driven approach, having previously achieved a 50% reduction in process rework.

* Rapid, Scalable Solution Delivery: I excel at developing practical tools to solve user problems, such as deploying a cost-effective Hot Desk Booking solution in three weeks. My expertise as a Microsoft Power Platform Solution Architect allows me to build scalable applications and dashboards that provide actionable insights for on-ground decision-making.
My experience managing APAC-wide projects has honed my ability to secure stakeholder buy-in, lead change, and ensure successful implementation in cross-functional settings. I am confident that my strategic and technical skills can contribute significantly to Jurong Port's vision of becoming a next-generation multipurpose port.
